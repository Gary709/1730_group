Question 2: If you are part of a group, write the ANU IDs of ALL
members of this group. If you are doing the assignment on your own
(not part of a group), just write "not part of a group".

Question 3: Select a piece of code in your assignment solution that
you have written, and explain:

        # Dealing with situation if one country's info is not enough to predict
        try:

            # Calculating population using fully vaccinated proportion
            population = float(detail[cols['people_fully_vaccinated']]) / \
                         float(detail[cols['people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred']]) * 100

            # Calculating the rest population to achieve 80% fully vaccinated
            rest_population = population * (80 - current_proportion) / 100

            # Calculating the daily growth by average daily vaccinations subs daily first vaccinated
            daily_growth = float(detail[cols['daily_vaccinations']]) - float(detail[cols['daily_people_vaccinated']])

            # Deal with situation if growth is less or equal than 0
            if daily_growth <= 0: rest_days = "infinite"
            else: rest_days = int(rest_population / daily_growth) + 1

            # Final output of Q(4)
            print("{}: {}% population fully vaccinated, {} days to 80%".format(country, current_proportion, rest_days))
        except TypeError:
            print("{}: {}% population fully vaccinated, but unable to predict how many days to 80%, "
                  "due to lack of information".format(country, current_proportion))

(a) What does this piece of code do?

This code is used to predict each of the ten countries found in Q4 (a). It predicts for each of these country that how
many days they will take to reach 80% fully vaccinated rate.

The assumption of this code is that we have found the ten countries mentioned, and we have found the corresponding
meaningful latest data of these countries. Meaningful here means that the latest row of data found by the country has
all the information we need. If we can't find that one, we throw an exception that we can't predict this country.

Another limitation is that we may encounter a divisor of 0 when calculating the population and rest days. Our statistics
show that the divisor used to calculate the population is not 0 for all countries, so we do not care. For rest days, we
make the number of days equal to infinity when the divisor is 0.

(b) How does it work?

Equation:
rest days = (p_goal - p_current) * n_population / n_growth

where:
	p_goal = 80%
	p_current = calculated in Q4(a)
	n_population = (n_people_fully_vaccinated / n_people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred)%
	n_growth = n_daily_vaccinations - n_daily_people_vaccinated

Explanation:
Basically we want to measure the current growth rate of total vaccination, which is obtained by subtracting the number
of people vaccinated for the first shot from the total number of vaccinations per day. Both data can be obtained
directly by reading the data.

But we only have the rest proportion to 80%, not a real number, so we have to calculate the population of each country.
We pick out two most common data, daily_vaccinations and daily_people_vaccinated, which an be divided and get the number
of population.

Finally we just divide the rest population to 80% by current growth number, we get the rest days to 80%.
Notice that In order to meet the conditions of "at least 80%", we round the result down and add one.

(c) What other possible ways did you consider to implement this
functionality, and why did you choose the one you did?

Alternative 1:
We have considered when calculating the average daily growth, introduce the approximate value of booster shot(third
shot) to make the average daily growth more accurate. So:

	n_growth = n_daily_vaccinations - n_daily_people_vaccinated - n_daily_booster
	n_daily_booster = n_total_boosters_today - n_total_boosters_yesterday

But first, not every country has total_boosters, and second not every day we have this data. When calculating daily
growth we have already use two 7-days-smoothing data, if we introduce such a sensitive non-smoothing data, the results
might be less accurate.

Alternative 2:
We have also considered using a longer average data rather than 7-days-smoothing data, i.e. using 14 days' averayge
daily vaccination, but due to the complex situation and influencing factors behind COVID-19, we believe that long-term
data smoothing will not necessarily be helpful for prediction. So we give up, and using a more intuitive based
prediction.
